Stack | Core Tools | AWS Compatibility | Pros | Cons / Trade-offs | Best Use Cases | Cost | Maturity
LangChain | LangChain, Agents, Memory, Tools | ✅ Native (S3, Bedrock, Lambda) | Flexible, Modular, Ecosystem-rich | Verbose, Complex configs, Steeper learning curve | RAG, multi-step workflows, LLM orchestration | Mostly Free (paid if using APIs like OpenAI) | Mature
LlamaIndex | Indexing, Data connectors, Agents | ✅ Supports S3, Bedrock | Great for structured & unstructured data, Flexible node-based memory | Less focused on agent workflows | Document Q&A, RAG pipelines | Free + LLM cost | Mature
AutoGen (Microsoft) | Multi-agent framework, open-loop | ⚠️ Limited AWS-native docs, but can self-host | Advanced multi-agent orchestration, conversational planning | Requires deeper understanding, fewer plug-and-play features | Research agents, Multi-agent collaboration | Free | Intermediate
CrewAI | Team-based agents | ✅ Can run on AWS Lambda or EC2 | Simple setup, role-defined agents, fast prototyping | Less customizable logic flow than LangChain | Task delegation, email + research agents | Free | Growing
Haystack | RAG & pipelines (Deepset) | ✅ Full AWS support, incl. OpenSearch | Production-grade RAG, Search-heavy workflows | Less focus on agents, more on RAG | Enterprise search, secure RAG | Free + Enterprise plans | Mature
Semantic Kernel (MS) | Planner, Skills, Memory | ⚠️ Azure-first but portable | C#/.NET & Python support, strong planning features | Azure-native tools first, steep for non-MS devs | Enterprise agentic automation | Free | Intermediate
MetaGPT | Engineer-like multi-agent system | ⚠️ Needs manual AWS setup | Software dev agents, uses SOPs | Complex YAML configs, limited docs | Autonomous software creation | Free | Experimental
Devin AI (Cognition) | Closed-source, SaaS only | ❌ Not open | Fully autonomous software dev agent | Not publicly available | Full dev lifecycle automation | Unknown | Proprietary
